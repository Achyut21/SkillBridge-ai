# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix React Version Conflict

### 1. Created `.npmrc` File
- Added `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle peer dependency conflicts
- Enables installation of packages with mismatched peer dependencies

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Added `overrides` section to force React 18.3.1 across all dependencies
- Downgraded Next.js from 15.3.4 to 14.2.30 for better React 18 compatibility
- Pinned React and React-DOM to exact version 18.3.1 (removed ^ prefix)
- Updated `vercel-build` script to include `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### 3. Updated `vercel.json`
- Changed buildCommand to use `npm run vercel-build` script
- Already has `installCommand` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

## Why These Changes
- Next.js 15.x automatically pulls in React 19, which conflicts with framer-motion
- Next.js 14.2.30 is stable and works perfectly with React 18
- The overrides ensure all packages use React 18.3.1 consistently
- Legacy peer deps flag allows npm to install packages despite version warnings

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Commit these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .npmrc package.json vercel.json
   git commit -m "fix: resolve React version conflict for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. Trigger new deployment on Vercel (it should auto-deploy on push)

3. If deployment still fails, check Vercel logs for any other issues

4. Once deployed, update environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, we can:
1. Update framer-motion to v11 which supports React 19
2. Or remove framer-motion and use CSS animations only
3. Or use a different animation library that supports React 19
